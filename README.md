When we find malicious code on a user’s website, we scan his files with a plugin such as ImunifyAV and check .lastlogin file for any suspicious IP addresses that have been reported in the AbuseIP database.

This plugin streamlines the process by allowing both SysAdmins and cPanel users to quickly view file content and check IPs in the AbuseIPDB.

### Support

Because this is a free plugin, support is restricted to maintaining the source code and ensuring that the plugin functions on latest cPanel version.

Please see the additional services area below if you require assistance outside of this scope, such as with plugin installation, branding, or integrating it with your custom template.

### Whats next
